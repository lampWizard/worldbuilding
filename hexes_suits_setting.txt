	PLANET 
	
	The planet of Kasser IV is the primordial home of humans,
	an intelligent and social species that has been recently struggling
	with spreading into space. 
	
	Kasser IV is currently a patchwork of various huge, terrifying metropolis
	scattered over barren wastelands. Much of the agricultural production
	is actually done in the megacities themselves, being able to produce
	more than enough food for its population--usually--out of necessity.
	The accessible and fairly calm areas of the wasteland have been converted
	into solar farms to help supply the planet's energy consumption.
	
	Although settlements and humans do exist and live outside of the cities,
	it is very rare for it to be the case. The planet itself is split into
	three main continents: Kaade, Adrallechia, and Cassin. Adrallechia is 
	not attached to the other two continents, which share a mountain range,
	but is rather the largest, separate land mass on Kasser IV. A harsh,
	domineering desert lies in Kaade and Adrallechia, while Cassin is home
	to many wastelands from centuries and decades old conflicts. Whatever
	groups manage to live outside of cities tend to be small and tenacious: 
	be they a smatter of religious sects, archaic cultural societies, 
	rebellious factions, or even criminal gangs.
