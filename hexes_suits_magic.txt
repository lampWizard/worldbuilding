	EXTERNALIZATION
	
	Externalization is the term given to the magic force that exists in this 
	world. Externalization serves one general purpose: to influence this reality
	from outside of itself, rather than within itself. In other words, users who
	practice externalization are able to conjure up power and ability that go 
	beyond reality's limits. There are four distinct ways to 'externalize':
		
		Stimulate: this type of externalization focuses on "speeding" up an object
			or for a user, as well as (if the user is sentient) increasing focus
			and dexterity.
			
			+dexterity
			+speed
			+focus
			+urgency
			
		Depress:
			
			+slow
			+calm
			+control
			+finesse
			
		Euphoria:
		
			+pacify
			+intensify
			+relax
			+motivate
			
		Hallucinate:
		
			+disassociate
			+influence
			+anxiety
			+investigate
			
	Full externalization is the "peak" of externalization, the moment an
	individual is able to tap into the well of an outsider or observer. There
	are two different types of observers: judges, and developers.
		
		Judge: this type of observer deals with interpreting reality--the judge
			comes after the developer in the hierarchy of observers, because its focus
			is not to create or destroy matter but rather interpret it: giving it
			actual qualities, and functions. 
		
		+interprets reality
			+quantifies objects ♣
			+qualifies objects ♦
			
		Developer: this type of observer deals with pulling things into and out of
			reality--the developer comes before the judge in the hierarchy of observers,
			because in order for an object to be judged or interpreted, it must be created
			or destroyed; matter is given form and shaped by this observer.
			
		+creates and destroys pieces of reality
			+"develops", giving form and function to matter over time ♥
			+"decays", matter that has been developed previously decays over time ♠
