	EXTERNALIZATION
	
	Externalization is the term given to the magic force that exists in this 
	world. Externalization serves one general purpose: to influence this reality
	from outside of itself, rather than within itself. In other words, users who
	practice externalization are able to conjure up power and ability that go 
	beyond reality's limits. There are four distinct ways to 'externalize':
		
		Stimulate: this type of externalization focuses on "speeding" up an object
			or for a user, as well as (if the user is sentient) increasing focus
			and dexterity.
