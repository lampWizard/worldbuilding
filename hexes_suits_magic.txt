	EXTERNALIZATION
	
	Externalization is the term given to the magic force that exists in this 
	world. Externalization serves one general purpose: to influence this reality
	from outside of itself, rather than within itself. In other words, users who
	practice externalization are able to conjure up power and ability that go 
	beyond reality's limits. There are four distinct ways to 'externalize':
		
		Stimulate: this type of externalization focuses on "speeding" up an object
			or for a user, as well as (if the user is sentient) increasing focus
			and dexterity.
			
			+dexterity
			+speed
			+focus
			+urgency
			
		Depress:
			
			+slow
			+calm
			+control
			+finesse
			
		Euphoria:
		
			+pacify
			+intensify
			+relax
			+motivate
			
		Hallucinate:
		
			+disassociate
			+influence
			+anxiety
			+investigate
			
	Full externalization is the "peak" of externalization, the moment an
	individual is able to tap into the well of an outsider or observer. There
	are two different types of observers: judges, and developers.
		
		Judge:
		
		+interprets reality
			+quantifies objects ♣
			+qualifies objects ♦
			
		Developer:
			
		+creates and destroys pieces of reality
			+"develops", giving form and function to matter over time ♥
			+"decays", matter that has been developed previously decays over time ♠
